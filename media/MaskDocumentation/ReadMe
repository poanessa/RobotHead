I enlisted the help of Mark Schneider of Faust & Company Mask and Collectibles (www.faustandcompany.com).
Mark has created a unique combination of materials to create masks that will no tear or deteriorate over time.  
This unique blend will ensure that the mask will last for years to come.  
Mark was able to give us a special discount of $300 for the initial mask.  
This included sculpting, casting and painting the mask, which was done with excruciating detail.  

Questions or inqueries about the mask should be directed to Mark via the website provided.
